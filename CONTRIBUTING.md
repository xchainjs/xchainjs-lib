### Submit your pull requests

We love contributions! If you would like to be become a contributor, please follow these steps:
1. Fork and create a branch with a descriptive name.
2. Make and document your changes.
3. XChainJS uses [Changeset](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for versioning. Once you have finished your changes, use the `yarn update-packages` command to set the size of the changes, do not manually change the package versions of xchain packages, Changeset will do this for you. With this command, you need to specify which packages you want to update with a major, a minor or a patch version and a descriptive changelog message. *Note: Navigate through the tool using the spacebar to select or deselect the packages and the Enter key to move to the next step.*
4. Add the changeset version file created in the `.changeset` folder to your pull request.
5. Open the pull request and add the aim the pull request has.
